This example demonstrates how to use the CrazyflieClient object to retrieve
Ad Hoc logging configurations of vehicle telemetry. In particular, this example
will demonstrate how to access a log variable only found a custom firmwareself.

In this example, the vehicle is logging a variable called 'eag.eag', which is a float
that represents the output voltage of an analog sensor.

This example is provided for reference, and will fail if the Crazyflie does not
contain an 'eag.eag' log variable.
